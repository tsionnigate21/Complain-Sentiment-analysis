## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹
1. Filter out blank and responseless complaints
   -This was nessesary so my table was more readable and easy for analysis.
 ```
   df_complaints <- df_complaints %>%
  filter(Consumer.complaint.narrative != "" & Company.public.response != "")
```
3. Rename the complaint column
   -I renamed the customer complaint narrative column to just Complain so its simplified to write.
  ```
 df_complaints <- df_complaints %>%
  rename(Complain = Consumer.complaint.narrative)
```
4. Create new table
   -Table contains Product, Complain, and Company columns

  ```
new_table <- df_complaints %>%
  select(Product, Complain, Company)
```

3. Load stop words
   -to remove common words
```   
data("stop_words")

```
4.Clean the text

```
     mutate(Complain = str_replace_all(Complain, "[[:punct:]]", "") %>%
         str_remove_all("\\d+") %>%
         str_squish()) %>%
  # Tokenize the complaints into individual words after cleaning
tidy_complaints <- new_table %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, Complain) %>%
  # Remove stop words, unnecessary characters, single characters, and numbers
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>%
  filter(!grepl("[^[:alnum:][:space:]]", word)) %>%
  filter(nchar(word) > 1) %>%
  filter(!grepl("\\d+", word))
```
