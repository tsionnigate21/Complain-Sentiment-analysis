## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹
1. # Filter out blank and responseless complaints
   This was nessesary so my table was more readable and easy for analysis.
   df_complaints <- df_complaints %>%
  filter(Consumer.complaint.narrative != "" & Company.public.response != "")

2. Rename the complaint column
   I rnamed the customer complaint narrative column to just Complain so its simplified to write.
   df_complaints <- df_complaints %>%
  rename(Complain = Consumer.complaint.narrative)

3. Cleaned the data frame by removing punctuations, numbers and spaces.
   df_complaints$Complain <- str_replace_all(df_complaints$Complain, "[[:punct:]]", "")
   df_complaints$Complain <- str_remove_all(df_complaints$Complain, "\\d+")
   df_complaints$Complain <- str_squish(df_complaints$Complain)

4. Creating new table
   Created a nnew table with just the colums i will be using for my analysis.
   consumer_complaints <- df_complaints%>%
     dplyr::select(Company, Product, Complain, Consumer.disputed., Timely.response. )
